        Welcome to Grid Operator! You are in control of the supply of the world's energy resources.
        Your goal is to transition from using non-renewable energy sources, while continuing to meet the global populations energy demands.
        Don't run out of money! Don't let the world burn! Don't let the world collapse!
      </p>
      <p>
        At the top of the screen, you have a clock to watch time pass, you can see how much money you've accrued,
        and you can see how much power you are delivering compared to the amount demanded.
        The emoji bar will change size and color depending on how happy you are making everyone. You can also watch your existing fossil fuels dwindle. Uh oh!
      </p>
      <p>
        You can purchase renewable and non-renewable energy resources by clicking on items in the top two rows.
        As you do, you'll see solar panels pop up below. These solar panels will degrade over time though. Make sure you save money to keep them operating at full capacity!
        This feature will be added next time.
      </p>
      <p>You can also purchase interns. They do not do anything in this game yet.</p>
    
      <p>Good luck! May the odds be ever in your favor.</p>
